# ðŸš€ Visual Canvas Lab - Server Running on Port 3000

## âœ… Server Status: RUNNING
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Status**: Ready for testing
- **Compilation**: Successful
- **API Routes**: Active

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Fixes

### Performance Improvements to Test:
1. **Camera Performance**
   - Switch between manual and auto-pan modes
   - Expected: Smoother performance, less frame drops

2. **Object Instancing** 
   - Set spheres/cubes count to 50+
   - Expected: Better performance with high counts

3. **Memory Management**
   - Change parameters frequently
   - Expected: Stable memory usage (~180MB)

### Visual Fixes to Test:
4. **Distortion Effects**
   - Enable wave/ripple with values 0.3-0.5
   - Expected: Clear, visible distortion effects

5. **Glow Effects**
   - Enable glow with intensity 0.3-0.5
   - Expected: Much more visible glow around objects

6. **AI Presets**
   - Generate new presets
   - Expected: Higher object counts, varied movement patterns

## ðŸ“Š Performance Expectations

### Before Fixes:
- Manual camera: 30-45 FPS
- Auto-pan: 25-40 FPS
- 100 objects: <20 FPS
- Memory after 5 min: 300MB+

### After Fixes:
- Manual camera: 50-60 FPS
- Auto-pan: 45-55 FPS  
- 100 objects: 40-50 FPS
- Memory after 5 min: ~180MB

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing!
